### About Me
I am Gyumin Shin, a third-year undergraduate at UC Riverside. Ever since I got into middle school, I was interested smartphones and tablets. The applications I used mattered for my productivity. I love analyzing app designs that attracts my interest that I would even download them just by how good they look. Through competitive selection process, I was selected as one of the Apple Coding Design Intern to work with my teammates to design an working app for a nearby business to help them promote their programs. Recently, my teammates and I talked to our client to design an app that could promote their anti-bullying and mental health programs.
